NTLM authentication for Axis2/C clients using default http transport is made possible by writing a wrapper over
an existing NTLM client library.

By default NTLM authentication is disabled in Axis2/C build. to enable NTLM authentication
user need to configure Axis2/C with an external  NTLM library like Heimdal[1] or libntlm[2]

NTLM support is added to Axis2/C client transport as a dynamically loadedable library called axis2c_ntlm.
This library will wrap an external NTLM library like Heimdal to provide NTLM support. Axis2/C is shipped with
a wrapper to Heimdal which you can find under heimdal subdirectory in <AXIS2C_SRC>/src/core/transport/http/sender/ntlm. 
However Heimdal has a bug where the server authentication fail intermittently, with a message from server saying 
provided credentials are not valid, even when the provided credentials are perfectly valid.

We have tested successfully with a wrapper to libntlm[2] as well which is included here. This wrapper works fine.

One can write a wrapper to any other external NTLM libary of his choice by implementing axis2_ntlm.h header file and
studying the libntlm wrapper here.

Following is the detail on how to use this wrapper with Axis2/C to enable NTLM authentication support for Axis2/C.

1). Install libntlm. In dabian flavours you can install this by
    apt-get install libntlm0

2). Add the following entries into configure.ac which reside at the Axis2/C root source directory.

AC_MSG_CHECKING(whether to build libntlm ntlm wrapper library)
AC_ARG_ENABLE(libntlm, [  --enable-libntlm    
                          build libntlm ntlm library wrapper (default=no)],
[ case "${enableval}" in
  no)
    AC_MSG_RESULT(no)
    NTLM_WRAPPER_DIR="default"
    NTLM_SAMPLE_DIR=""
    ;;
  *)
    AC_MSG_RESULT(yes)
    NTLM_WRAPPER_DIR="libntlm"
    NTLM_SAMPLE_DIR="ntlm"
    CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -DAXIS2_LIBNTLM_ENABLED -DAXIS2_NTLM_ENABLED"
    CPPFLAGS="$CPPFLAGS $NTLM_CFLAGS -DAXIS2_LIBNTLM_ENABLED -DAXIS2_NTLM_ENABLED"
    LDFLAGS="$LDFLAGS $NTLM_LDFLAGS"
    ;;
  esac ],
  AC_MSG_RESULT(no)
)

And under AC_CONFIG_FILES entry add following Makefile entry

    src/core/transport/http/sender/ntlm/libntlm/Makefile

3) Generate the configure script from configure.ac by running autogen.sh in Axis2/C root directory.

4) Set the following flags

export NTLM_LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib -lntlm"
Note: Provide the path correctly as in your system.

5)Now to enable libntlm library at build time configure Axis2/C with following option
configure --enable-libntlm=yes

There are some examples of using NTLM authenticaion with Axis2/C clients under
<AXIS2C_SOURCE>/samples/client/ntlm subdirecory.
